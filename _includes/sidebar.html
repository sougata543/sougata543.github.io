  The picture above is a graph of an exponential sum. By the "graph" of an exponential sum 
  we mean the sequence of partial sums 
  $\sum_{n=1}^N e^{2\pi i f(n)}$, plotted in the complex plane, with successive points 
  joined by straight line segments. In this case 
  $f(n) = \tfrac{n^{3/2}}{5}$.
